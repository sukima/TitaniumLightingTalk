<<<
On platforms that use native code (Android, iOS, and BlackBerry), the Proxy type represents a JavaScript wrapper or proxy around a native object. Setting or getting a property on a proxy object results in a method invokation on the native object. Likewise, calling a method on the proxy object results in a method invokation on the native object.
